* personal dotfiles

* installation
not tested yet
** install basic nixos to the machine
** enable flakes
in `config.nix` add
#+begin_src nix
  nix = {
    package = pkgs.nixUnstable;
    extraOptions = ''
      experimental-features = nix-command flakes
    '';
  };
#+end_src
and apply the config
** pull in repo (or possibly nix can install flake by github address too)
and apply config with
#+begin_src bash
sudo nixos-rebuild switch --flake ~/dotfiles/.#chunky-notebook
#+end_src

Any "home-manager" related updates are also done with that command
* todo
- After migration to flake, usage of "home-manager" on non NixOS machines is not yet fixed =C
- Manage the personal server with NixOS too
