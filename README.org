* personal dotfiles

* installation
not tested yet
** install basic nixos to the machine
** enable flakes
in `config.nix` add
#+begin_src nix
  nix = {
    package = pkgs.nixUnstable;
    extraOptions = ''
      experimental-features = nix-command flakes
    '';
  };
#+end_src
and apply the config
** pull in repo (or possibly nix can install flake by github address too)
and apply config with
#+begin_src bash
sudo nixos-rebuild switch --flake ~/dotfiles/.#chunky-notebook
#+end_src

Any "home-manager" related updates are also done with that command
* notes on structure
** Profiles :: Granular application/service configurations
(expected to be imported on `home-manager.users.<user>` level, if in future would want OS level modules would need to figure out anew)
Read in the flake.nix, passed with inputs.self.nixosProfiles
Could contain NixOS configuration & options as well as Home-Manager configuraitons, options & xdg files

Idea is to keep relevant nix configuration close to managed dotfiles
and join configurations for applications that are managed in tandem

Intended for grouping in the Roles, so that Roles could be imported for machines
** Modules :: defining options
(expected to be imported on `home-manager.users.<user>` level, if in future would want OS level modules would need to figure out anew)
Option - is a value that can be set differently
and which influences some part of configuration

My own modules are:
- autorandr sharing window configuration, by individual computer defining monitor fingerprints
- screenlocker setting different 'lock' command, to share code between NixOS & Ubuntu installed 'xscreensaver'

** Roles :: High level bundles of configuration
(doesn't work yet - only Home-Manager common file there)
Planned to combine lot's of applications and settings
so that machines would only need to specify their roles, and limited amount of profiles

* todo
- make `cachix add nix-community` declarative
- !! disable `emacsPgtkGcc` durnig install, since `cachix add nix-community` is manual for now
- After migration to flake, usage of "home-manager" on non NixOS machines is not yet fixed =C
- Manage the personal server with NixOS too
