#+TITLE: mail
with notmuch

on server - mbsync to get messages from mailboxes

muchsync on client and server to sync messages and notmuch tags

on server:
notmuch new - triggers mbsync and afew
but no systemd jobs

on client:
muchsync job

executes local notmuch new - to sync tags, trigger afew
executes remote notmuch new - so server syncs with mailboxes and processes tags

existing problem - ssh has passphrase, for now bad hack is to use sdd-add
