#+TITLE: mail
* with mu4e
mu - mail indexing program, all state is stored in maildir.
mu4e - interface for emacs.

mbsync - to read mail, external program
msmtp - to send mail, external program

both of these can be configured from home-manager email options

Since all mail state is stored in maildir, simple syncing via mbsync is enough, same config on all machines should work.

* possible auth
mu4e uses mbsync, and all machines that read mail are clients
(opposed to with notmuch one machine needing to be a server for xapian database \ tags)
so all machines would have same config with password for synching mail to local storage, quite simple
