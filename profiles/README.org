#+TITLE: Profiles

* Granular application/service configurations
Read in the flake.nix, passed with inputs.self.nixosProfiles
Could contain NixOS configuration & options as well as Home-Manager configuraitons, options & xdg files

Idea is to keep relevant nix configuration close to managed dotfiles
and join configurations for applications that are managed in tandem

Intended for grouping in the Roles, so that Roles could be imported for machines
